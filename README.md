# Tokenometry

A tool that measures and analyzes all the critical data points of a crypto token—such as its price, volume, volatility, and market sentiment—to help users make informed decisions.

## Crypto Analysis Bot

This repository contains a sophisticated, multi-strategy crypto analysis bot written in Python. The bot is designed to scan the cryptocurrency market, apply a range of analytical models, and generate trading signals based on a confluence of technical, sentiment, and on-chain data. It is architected to be flexible, allowing the user to switch between long-term investment, swing trading, and high-frequency day trading strategies.

## Features

* **Multi-Asset Scanning**: Monitors a configurable list of cryptocurrencies from Coinbase.
* **Multi-Timeframe Analysis (MTA)**: Establishes a long-term trend on a higher timeframe to filter and confirm signals on a lower timeframe.
* **Multi-Factor Signal Confirmation**:
    * **Technical Analysis**: Utilizes a robust combination of indicators, including Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), the Relative Strength Index (RSI), and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD).
    * **News Sentiment Analysis**: Integrates with NewsAPI to gauge the prevailing market narrative and filter signals that run contrary to strong market sentiment.
    * **On-Chain Analysis**: Connects to the Glassnode API to analyze fundamental investor behavior, such as accumulation or distribution patterns based on exchange net flows.
* **Automated & Continuous Operation**: Designed to run 24/7 on a server, with a configurable analysis frequency and comprehensive logging for performance tracking and debugging.
* **Dynamic Risk Management**: Automatically calculates a suggested stop-loss and position size for every BUY signal based on market volatility (using the Average True Range - ATR) and a predefined risk percentage.
* **Secure Configuration**: All API keys and sensitive information are managed securely using an `.env` file.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/nguyenph88/Tokenometry.git](https://github.com/nguyen/Tokenometry.git)
    cd Tokenometry
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up your API keys:**
    * Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project.
    * Add your API keys to this file. The bot will gracefully handle missing keys by skipping the corresponding analysis.
    ```
    NEWS_API_KEY=your_key_from_newsapi_org
    GLASSNODE_API_KEY=your_key_from_glassnode
    ```

## Usage

To run the bot, simply execute the Python script corresponding to the strategy you wish to use from your terminal.

* **For Long-Term Analysis (runs every 24 hours):**
    ```bash
    python milestone_7.py
    ```

* **For Aggressive Swing Trading (runs every 4 hours):**
    ```bash
    python milestone_10_aggressive.py
    ```

* **For Day Trading (runs every 5 minutes):**
    ```bash
    python milestone_11_daytrader.py
    ```

The bot will start running immediately, and all output, signals, and errors will be logged to a file (e.g., `crypto_scanner.log` or `crypto_daytrader.log`) in the same directory.
